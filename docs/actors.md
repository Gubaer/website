# Actors

The actor model is a conceptual model to deal with concurrent computation<sup>[1]</sup>. At the core of the Riker framework are four main components:

- `ActorSystem` - Every Riker application has an `ActorSystem` that manages actor lifecycles
- `Actor` - Rust types that implement the `Actor` trait so they may receive messages
- `Props` - Each `Actor` requires a `Props` to describe how an `Actor` should be created
- `ActorRef` - A lightweight type that is inexpensive to clone and can be used to interact with its underlying `Actor` such as sending messages to it

Let's look at each of these and see how a simple application is created.

## Defining Actors

An Actor is the fundamental unit of computation. Actors communicate only through messages in an asynchronous fashion. An actor can perform three distinct action based on the message it receive:

- send a finite number of messages to other actors
- create a finite number of new actors
- change its state or designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives

Actors interact with each other by passing messages. There is no assumed order to the above actions and they could be carried out concurrently. Two messages that are sent concurrently can arrive in either order.

To define an actor the system needs to understand how an actor should handle messages it receives. To do this, just implement the `Actor` trait on your data type and at a minimum provide a `receive` method.

Here's the Rust code:

```rust
struct MyActor;

impl Actor for MyActor {
    type Msg = String;

    fn receive(&mut self,
                ctx: &Context<Self::Msg>,
                msg: Self::Msg,
                sender: Option<ActorRef<Self::Msg>>) {

        println!("received {}", msg);
    }
}
```

In this example a simple struct `MyActor` implements the `Actor` trait. When a message is sent to `MyActor` it is scheduled by the system for immediate execution. The `receive` function is invoked and the message is printed to stdout.

## Creating Actors

Every application has an `ActorSystem`. The actor system provides actor management and the runtime to execute actors when they're sent messages. It also provides essential services such as starting actors and exposing system services. 

To start the actor system:

```rust
let model: DefaultModel<String> = DefaultModel::new();
let sys = ActorSystem::new(&model).unwrap();
```

Here we see that the actor is started using `ActorSystem::new`. But what is this model? The model allows us to configure the message type used in our application and configure which modules to use for core services. We'll revisit the model in detail later in this documentation.

Once we've started the actor system we're ready to start up some actors.

To start an actor:

```rust
let props = Props::new(Box::new(MyActor::new));
let my_actor = sys.actor_of(props, "my-actor");
```

Every actor requires a `Props` that wraps the actor's factory method, in this example `MyActor::new`, and any parameters required by that method. `Props` is then used with `actor_of` to create an instance of the actor. A name is also required so that we can look it up later if we need to.

Although this is just two lines of code a lot is happening behind the scenes. Actor lifecycles and state are managed by the system. When an actor starts it keeps the properies in case it needs it again to restart the actor if it fails. When an actor is created it gets its own mailbox for receiving messages and other interested actors are notified about the new actor joining the system.

## Actor References

When an actor is started using `actor_of` the system returns a reference to the actor, an `ActorRef`. The actual actor instance remains directly inaccessible, its lifecycle managed and protected by the system. In Rust terms, the system has and always maintains 'ownership' of the actor instance. When you're interacting with actors you're actually interacting with the actor's `ActorRef`! This is a core concept of the actor model.

`ActorRef` always refers to a specific instance of an actor. When two instances of the same `Actor` are started they're still considered separate actors, each with different `ActorRef`s.

!!! note
    `ActorRef`s are inexpensive and can be cloned (they implement `Clone`) without too much concern about resources. References can also be used in `Props` as a field in another actor's factory method, a pattern known as endowment. `ActorRef` is also `Send`, so it can be sent as a message to another actor.

## Sending Messages

Actors can communicate only through messages. They are isolated. They can never expose their state or behavior.

If we want to send an actor a message we use the `tell` method on the actor's `ActorRef`:

```rust
let my_actor = sys.actor_of(props, "my-actor");
myactor.tell("Hello my actor!".into(), None);
```

Here we've sent a message of type `String` to our `MyActor` actor. The second parameter let's us specify a sender as an `Option<ActorRef>`. Since we're sending the message from `main` and not from an actor's `receive` we're setting the sender as `None`.

Riker provides certain guarantees when handling messages:

- Message delivery is 'at-most-once'. A message will either fail to be delivered, or delivered one time. There is no repeat delivery of the same message.
- An actor handles one message at any time
- Messages are stored in an actor's mailbox in order that they are received

## Example

Let's go back to our `MyActor` and combine what we've seen so far in to a complete example:

`Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
riker = "0.2.2"
riker-default = "0.2.2"
```

`main.rs`:

```rust
extern crate riker;
extern crate riker_default;
#[macro_use]
extern crate log;

use std::time::Duration;
use riker::actors::*;
use riker_default::DefaultModel;

struct MyActor;

// implement the Actor trait
impl Actor for MyActor {
    type Msg = String;

    fn receive(&mut self,
                _ctx: &Context<Self::Msg>,
                msg: Self::Msg,
                _sender: Option<ActorRef<Self::Msg>>) {

        debug!("Received: {}", msg);
    }
}

// provide factory and props functions
impl MyActor {
    fn actor() -> BoxActor<String> {
        Box::new(MyActor)
    }

    fn props() -> BoxActorProd<String> {
        Props::new(Box::new(MyActor::actor))
    }
}

// start the system and create an actor
fn main() {
    let model: DefaultModel<String> = DefaultModel::new();
    let sys = ActorSystem::new(&model).unwrap();

    let props = MyActor::props();
    let my_actor = sys.actor_of(props, "my-actor").unwrap();

    my_actor.tell("Hello my actor!".to_string(), None);

    std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
}
```

Here we've started the actor system and an instance of `MyActor`. Lastly we sent a message to the actor. You'll also notice we also provided a factory function `actor()` and props function `props()` as part of `MyActor`'s implementation.

!!! note
    If an actor's factory method requires parameters you can use `Props::new_args`. See the Rustdocs for an example.
